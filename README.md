# ImpossibleDIfferentialAnalysis
The automatic search tool for Impossible differential cryptanalysis.
This code is supplementary material to the paper "Automatic Search Tool for Related-Tweakey Impossible Differential Cryptanalysis".
The design and analysis of dedicated tweakable block ciphers is a relatively modern and dynamic research field in symmetric cryptanalysis. The public tweak makes evaluating the security under the related-tweakey model critical. Inspired by Hu et al.'s automatic search tool for impossible differentials in ASIACRYPT 2020, we propose an automatic search model for related-tweakey impossible differentials by considering the propagation of states under specific constraints. This model is universal to any block ciphers but will be affected by poor search efficiency in some cases. Thus, as a point of innovation, we introduce the Locality Constraint Analysis (LCA) technique to impossible differential cryptanalysis and propose a generalized automatic search model. Technically, we convert our models into Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems to be solved with the STP solver and apply them to several tweakable block ciphers (including Joltik-BC, SKINNY, CRAFT, QARMA, MANTIS) for evaluating the effectiveness and practicality of our automatic search tools.
